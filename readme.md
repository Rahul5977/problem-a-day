# 🚀 CP + LeetCode Streak

From **20th Aug 2025**, I’m challenging myself to stay consistent with problem solving:

* 🔹 **1 problem/day** from [CP31 Sheet](https://codeforces.com/) (starting 1300 rating)
* 🔹 **1–2 problems/day** from **LeetCode Top Interview**

I’ll be uploading my solutions **day-wise** and tracking my progress here.

Would you like me to also add a **GitHub badge (dynamic counter)** that shows your streak automatically on the README?
